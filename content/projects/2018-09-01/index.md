## Background
SiteServe is a Full Stack Vue application using Sequelize and Express.js on the backend.

It features authentication; you can register and log in. Once logged in, you can add websites that you'd like to save, entering the URL, title, description, and image. All of that info is saved in the database file and displayed on the front page.
