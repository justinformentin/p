## Background
Lstner is a Podcast Dashboard app where you can browse by category, search podcasts by name, add podcasts to your favorite list, subscribe to podcasts, and of course listen to your favorite podcasts.

Lstner has a fully functional auth, so registered and logged in users have all their saved, played, subscribed, favorited, and in-progress podcasts saved in the database. Non-registered users have data saved in local storage.

Lstner is built with React using Meteor, as well as GraphQL and Apollo on the back end.
