I used to trade Forex a few years ago, and have bought and I have some money in the stock market, but I've never ventured into options territory. I'm trying to get more into it now, but it's obviously not as straightforward as buying and selling stocks.

It's not that any one part of dealing with options is too difficult, it's that there are a lot of moving parts to consider with a lot of different terminology and rules. This makes it difficult to keep straight in your head, especially when starting out.

So I started writing this as a reference for me to use, but I decided to publish my notes in the hopes that maybe one day it will help someone.

I'm also a *firm believer in the fact*(reword?) that teaching is the best way to learn something. So I wrote my notes in a way that lends itself to being consumed by others.

In my time reading and learning online, I found that actionable information is hard to extract as a beginner. Naturally the more I read the more questions I had and I often found myself wishing there were resources with straightforward answers.

Most articles or videos or other resources I ran into were some combination of platform specific tutorials, broad overviews, textbook style definitions, opinion pieces, get rich quick scams, with a few useful and digestible pieces of information here and there.

### Exercising Early
