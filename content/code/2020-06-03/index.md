Have you ever had an error that seemingly pops up out of nowhere even though you're sure everything was working fine a second ago, and you didn't change anything?

<!-- And then much like a deus ex machina when an abrupt car crash lets a movie protaganist escape at the last second,  -->

Sometimes these errors disappear with as much warning and reason as they appeared in the first place.

Most error messages aren't exactly helpful, so you wonder if you had just missed some related information that was temporarily screwing something up, or you're left to realize that a problematic for loop has triggered solipsism.
