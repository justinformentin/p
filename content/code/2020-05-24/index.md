Write comments. Write documentation. It's as simple as that. If anybody tells you their code is self documenting, they're mistaken. The people whose code truly is as close to self documenting as possible, are the types of people that wouldn't say that phrase. You'd have to be incredibly conceited to believe that your code is so amazing and clear that you don't need to write any comments at all, and everyone will just perfectly understand your code the firs time they read it. That phrase has almost turned into a joke, yet I still hear people say that their code is self document and mean it seriously.

I hear the argument: "Well, outdated comments are as good as useless" as if that's a good excuse to not write comments in the first place. No kidding outdated comments are useless. You need to update them. That would be like arguing against buying a plant because they die unless you water them. If you don't want to kill plants, your two options are to either not buy a plant in the first place, or to water the plant. There's no third option. Code and comments should be viewed the same way. And unless you're completely changing a function, even a slightly outdated comment will be more helpful than none at all.

You will update your code in the future, that's almost guaranteed. While updating the code, you update the comment. That's it. It's like anything else- tests, documentation, etc. It's work that needs to be completed, and is part of the coding process. You don't complain about needing to write a function to make you app work, right? So you shouldn't complain about needing to write a comment on that function.

And it's not just for you. Someone will read your code in the future, and they will inevitably need to re-read your "clean, self documenting code" multiple times to understand what you were doing. Even if you really are good about naming, structure, whatever, maybe the next person that comes along won't have as much experience as you, and they'll need help understanding that totally necessary, cool and efficient abstraction that you wrote. Have a little empathy. It doesn't matter how good you are at naming things, or how clear you think certain parts of the code are - what is obvious to you, and what is obvious to someone else are never the same.

And even if nobody else will ever read your code, there will be a time that you need to go back to old code. Maybe it's tomorrow, maybe next week, maybe next year, and maybe and you won't remember exactly what's going on in the code. And you will wish you had even a single line comment.

If you're still not convinced, you should try one or both of these exercises. Go find someone else that claims their code is self documenting and task yourself with reading and understanding a portion of it. Or even better, post your code online and ask for critique.
