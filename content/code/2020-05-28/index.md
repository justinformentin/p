There was a time when the "web" was a much simpler place. You used HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and PHP and you built websites with some text and some images, and that was it.

The "Web" has become so much more complex, with many different tools, platforms, and disciplines, that it's not fair to call anyone a "web developer" anymore, because that term tells you literally nothing other than you do something tangentially related to the internet.

Thinking off the top of my head, here's a list of different types of people that others would consider "Web Developers"

- Uses Wordpress drag and drop theme builders, and then edits some CSS.
- An expert in PHP and JavaScript and creates custom Wordpress sites.
- Creates simple static sites with HTML and CSS.
- A JavaScript expert that can build complicated websites with current best practices and tools.
- Someone that barely knows JavaScript and HTML, but they know enough to help edit a React or Vue website.
- Builds advanced tools or SDKs that other website and app developers use.
- Creates advanced apps with JavaScript, but doesn't necessarily ever build websites.
- Using tools like Django or Laravel to create websites.
- Someone that that knows the ins and outs of setting up VPSes, hosting, enough backend knowledge to put together a database connection, and hook everything up to websites.
- Someone that uses tools like React Native, Flutter, Cordova, or Ionic Framework, and builds websites and native apps in tandem, knowing enough native code to get by.


The variation in capabilities of different people who could all be considered "web developers" is astonishing.
****^^^^fix sentence***

I'd like to make it clear that I'm not writing about this for gatekeeping purposes. Everybody that identifies with an item in the list above *is* a web developer, and that's exactly the problem.

One problem I can think of is finding a job, and hiring. I've seen this first hand when my company tried to hire a developer(link to post about hriing difficulties)[link link link]

The problem is that there's a high probability that every type of person on that list will run into some problem when looking for a job, and likewise companies will have problems.




This is just a quick example that I made up, but from my experiences I know this is very far from reality for a lot of people. Companies waste time interviewing people, people waste time interviewing for position they wouldn't want or couldn't get. All because the term "Web Developer" is too broad.

### Naming

We all know how important, yet difficult, naming is when it comes to writing code. (link to naming difficult article)[linklink]. But we all just shrug our shoulders when it comes to determining titles that we hold.

I don't know what the solution is, I don't know what the correct titles should be. What I do know is that using the term "Web Developer" so interchangeabley(**not right word. Should be word that means "in a thrown around way", "not seriouslly" (kind of) , etc**) is wrong.

I recognize that going the opposite direction and using specific names are incorrect too. Just because you used something like Django or React at work for a number of years doesn't mean you want to pigeonhole yourself as a "Django" or a "React" developer when you're capable of much more than that.

There needs to be terms and titles that are indicative of meaning somewhere in between "I write code that's on the internet" and "I write code in this one specific tool". And I'm not placing the burden solely on developers. It would actually be more meaningful for companies to change their terminology.
