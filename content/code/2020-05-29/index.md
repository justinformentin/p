How many times have you read one of these complaints in a comment online, or heard it in person?

A library is:
- Slow
- Overkill
- Too bloated
- Too complicated
- Too much boilerplate
- Not enough boilerplate
- Doesn't cook me dinner

Most likely countless times. If you have some experience, it's easy to write those people off for any number of reasons. But if you're a beginner, you're probably trying to read as much information as you can absorb as quickly as possible, and comments like these are bound to throw you off.

You see comments talking about how terrible a tool is, but then you see the gigantic community around around it with people singing its praises. What's going on and who should you listen to?

The short answer is listen to everyone to gain insight, but don't make any decisions based on what someone online says and instead make informed decisions based on personal experiences. The best way to learn is to physically use the tools.

<!-- If that answer is sufficient for you, that's great and I give you permission to stop reading. If not, I'll further explain why you should be wary of random internet comments and I'm going to do so by making a lot of comparisons. Mainly about birdhouses, just warning you.

I bet you wish you had stopped reading, don't you? But now you're too invested. You've always loved birdhouses. -->

I hope to explain why the use of tools shouldn't be .....

To build a birdhouse the absolute bare minimum you need is a hand saw, a hammer and nails, a drill, and maybe some sandpaper and paint. These tools can be bought for a few bucks, and that's literally all you need.

Now lets say your birdhouses are really popular and you're selling them online nonstop. Sawing and sanding all of the wood by hand is really tiring you out. So you buy some electric tools from the hardware store.

Maybe you buy a table saw, a router, and a power sander. They cost a bit more, and you need to take more precautions when using them, but the amount of time they save you easily pay for themselves in no time.

Now image that for some strange reason the popularity of your birdhouses has exploded. You scale up production and you now own an small birdhouse factory. You hire multiple workers and tons of heavy machinery to enable your workers to produce thousands of birdhouses per hour.

At each step, the tools you purchase make sense for the level of production. At the same time, the tools from the steps above are inconsequential. The guy making a birdhouse in his garage isn't even thinking about million dollar automatic planers. The increase in cost and complexity makes sense when it returns an increase in volume and quality of birdhouses.

My point is, there is a large number of developers that need simple tools and that's fine.

There are also developers that need to write much more complex code. To do so, they reach for much more complex tools. Sure, some of the tools require more experience to fully grasp, and it takes time to read the documentation to learn how to use them.

You can argue about which tool is better, but you can't argue against their use in the first place. Nobody would use complicated tools if they weren't worth it. The idea is to spend more time up front which saves more time later.
