Hiring JavaScript developers is difficult. The main contributing factor is that the JavaScript universe is so large. You have tooling, backend, frontend, and a ton of subcategories. And the space between all of these subcategories is gigantic.

While other languages might have similar issues, I don't think they're even close to the same level as JavaScript.

Take a Java developer for example. It doesn't matter what tools or frameworks your company is using, you can normally be sure most Java developers will be able to handle it, or at least quickly learn how. The same cannot be said about JavaScript developers.

It's common to see front end developers who can't write any backend code, and backend developers who can't write any front end code. While it is all the same language, the skill sets required for each area in the JavaScript world are too dissimilar.

Another issue is that tools have become so powerful that developers are able to stay in their niche and never need to venture further. There are plenty of React developers who have a lot React experience, write great code and get paid well, but they might not know a lot of basic JavaScript because it's all abstracted away by React.

This leads to a disparity where "years of experience" is not equivalent to skill level, unless their experience is in a specific area. This is a real issue when you're trying to fill a specific role. I've conducted interviews where numerous candidates technically had twice the years of experience necessary for the role, but they failed to answer basic questions.

A possible solution to this problem would require two things. Companies need to be hyper specific in their job listings, and the description/requirements in the listing needs to be written **or** edited by someone with related experience.

Here are a few examples job listings that comes up if I search "javascript developer" on Indeed.

Listing 1:

1. Experience with HTML, VueJs, CSS.
2. A meticulous eye for design.
3. Experience publishing with Wordpress.

This is way too broad and it tells us nothing about the role. I guarantee the CEO would not describe what the company does as "meticulously designed Vue sites".

Here's another listing that is far too broad.

Listing 2:

1. Experience using React, VueJs, EmberJs, Angular.
2. Experience with NodeJs.
3. Familiar with git.
4. Familiar with NPM.

That's just a list of things their developers use! How is that even a requirements list? They might as well continue down the list.

5. Experience typing on a keyboard.
6. Familiar with the internet.

I also really appreciate the sporadic "Js" suffix to drive home the point that the person writing this has no experience in this area.

The job listing should explain what the company does, and exactly what's expected of the applicant in multiple specific details. If you just say "React experience" or "JavaScript experience", you're not actually giving any useful information and you'll get many applicants who are either very overqualified, or very underqualified.
